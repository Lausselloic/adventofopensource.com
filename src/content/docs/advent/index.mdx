Hi there! I'm **Julien DÃ©ramond**. You're on the official website of the **Advent of Open Source** event, first edition in 2024. I hope you'll enjoy this event as much as I did creating it.
I'm a Design System tech lead, but also deeply involved in the Open Source community. I'm the creator of the [Open \{re\}Source](https://openresource.dev) project, and one of the maintainers of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/julien-deramond) where you'll find all my projects, contributions, and links to social media.

Each year, tons of developers participate to the famous official [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), but also to special, local, and specific events in that spirit.

**Advent of Open Source** is one of them. It is a community-driven event that aims to introduce newcomers to Open Source Software development, and to help all participants to create or enhance their repositories, small, medium, or large.

It's a 24-day event that will take place from December 1st to December 24th, 2024.

Each day, around 06:00 to 08:00 CET, you'll access a new challenge to complete. The challenges are designed to help you learn new skills, improve your existing skills, and to help you create or enhance your repositories.

It's a great opportunity to learn, to share, and to have fun with other participants.

## 3 levels of tracks

Each day, you'll be able to choose between three levels of tracks, identified by runes:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; justify-content: center; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div style="max-width: 150px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 5px; align-items: center; margin: 0">
    <div style="text-decoration: none; width: 100px; height: 100px; font-size: 60px; border-radius: 50%; border: 1px solid transparent; background-color: var(--sl-color-accent-low); margin: 0; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; color: var(--sl-color-accent)">
      <Image src={beginnerRune} alt="" />
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center">
      <strong>Snowflake rune</strong><br/>Beginner, you're starting a new project
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 150px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 5px; align-items: center; margin: 0">

    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 150px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 5px; align-items: center; margin: 0">

    <div style="text-align: center">

</div>

## How to participate

Basically, you just have to follow the instructions of the day. There's no registration, no leaderboard, no pressure. Just have fun and learn.

You can participate in the way you want: alone, with friends, with your company, with your school, with your community, etc.

## Helping each other

Open Source is community, is sharing, is helping each other.

That's why we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fpUDwEMGwE) where you can ask for help, share your progress, and help others. It's a great place to meet other participants and to have fun. We have a dedicated category, and a dedicated channel for each day of the event.

We'll also be present on social media, so don't hesitate to share your progress with the hashtag `#AdventOfOpenSource`:

- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/open-re-source/)
- [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@openresource)

## How to support

* You can **share this event** with your friends, your company, your school, your community, etc.
* You can **contribute to the source code** of this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-reSource/adventofopensource.com). Time is incredibly valuable.
* For **moral boost**, you can drop us and all participants a star, a like, a comment, a feedback. It's always appreciated.
* You can also **support financially** this event or the Open \{re\}Source project on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Open-reSource). No pressure, I got a job. It would just help to buy some tools, for the hosting, and maybe in the future to pay some folks if the project gets bigger.
